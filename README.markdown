This simple commodity turns your hard drive motor off if not used for a 
given period of time. Something like screen blanker, but for harddisks.
You may know what it is, because this is BIOS feature of all new PC
motherboards. Works only with A1200, A4000 and CD32 ProModule with IDE
hard drive(s). A600 isn't supported yet :-( maybe later...

Changes in v1.5:
----------------
- Now properly recognizes iorequests from variuos units. Master unit resets only master counter and slave unit only slave counter.
- Now works with new scsi.device from AI.
