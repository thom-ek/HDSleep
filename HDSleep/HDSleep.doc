Disclaimer

THIS PROGRAM IS FREELY DISTRIBUTABLE. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR RELIABLE FUNCTIONING OF THIS PROGRAM.

Introduction
============

  This utility turns the motor of your HD off if it isn't used for given period
of time. To install, copy HDSleep file to the WBStartup drawer on your hard
disk. Program installs itself as a commodity. There is also hotkey available for
turning off motor immediately. Any access to your hard disk turns the motor on
again. If you execute this commodity again it will deactivate itself. Of course
you can use Exchange for activating/deactivating HDSleep.

  I have tested it on:
Amiga 1200 + Viper 68030 turbo card and IDE 420MB Caviar 2420 hard drive,
Amiga 1200 + Blizzard III 68030 turbo card and IDE 540MB Caviar hard drive,
Amiga 1200 + Blizzard III 68030 turbo card and IDE 1.2GB Caviar hard drive,
Amiga 1200 + Blizzard II 68030 turbo card and IDE 420MB Conner hard drive,
Amiga 1200 + Blizzard III and 1.2GB Seagate hard drive,
Amiga 1200 + FastRAM and IDE 420MB Conner hard drive,
Amiga 4000 + IDE 850MB Caviar hard drive,
Amiga 4000 + IDE 1.2GB Conner hard drive,
and many other...
Program also has been tested with Enforcer.

  HDSleep does not work with Quantum (45MB) hard drives installed in A1200
with FastRAM, but I hope you should not have any problems with newer
drives.

Important
=========

If you encounter problems with resetting sleep timer and putting to sleep
your hard disk, insert the line below in startup-sequence before IPrefs - it
should work properly.
...
Run >NIL: HDSleep <parameters>
C:IPrefs
...

Requirements
============

  This program works only on A1200, A4000 and CD32 ProModule, because it
uses low level access to not documented IDE bus registers (although it
sends standard ATA command this way, so you shouldn't have any problems
with different drives which have implemented full set of ATA commands).
Also be sure you have both commodities.library and icon.library installed.
There will be no version for scsi units.

Parameters
==========

Parameter may be included as Tool Types in the icon or in the command line, if
you use it from Shell.

  CX_PRIORITY=<0>        - hotkey priority.
  CX_POPKEY=<ctrl alt h> - hotkey for opening window.
  CX_POPUP=<YES>         - opens window at start.
  HDSLEEPKEY=<control h> - hotkey.
  MASTERTIME=<360>       - turn off time since last access to Master HD
                           (in seconds), 0 means no turning off.
  SLAVETIME=<360>        - turn off time since last access to Slave HD
                           (in seconds), 0 means no turning off.
  WARNING=<NO>           - warns you about turning off of your HD.  A window is
                           opened on a default public screen.
  WARNINGTIMEOUT=<5>     - time when you will be warned before HD will go off.
  LOGFILE=<filename>     - the file name of a log file.
  A4000=<NO>             - the flag required for A4000. All A4000 owners should
                           use it for correct switching off their HDs.
  ELSAT=<NO>             - the flag required for CD32 ProModule. All CD32 owners
                           should use it for correct switching off their HDs.

Bugs
====

  One user of HDSleep reported me bug when working with AmiFileSafePro v15.9.
When disk was switched off RigidDiskBlock was cleared.  Better before running
HDSleep with AFS or PFS remember your RDB.  If you don't experience any problems
with AFS or PFS let me know.
